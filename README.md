# Rescue-API

The Rescue-API allows Node Operators to request credentials for the [Rescue Node](https://rescuenode.com)
([GitHub](https://github.com/Rocket-Rescue-Node/rescue-proxy)).


## Building

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local
machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements

  * [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.19 or higher
  * [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Build

```bash
make build
```

## Usage

```
Usage of ./rescue-api:
  -addr string
	Address on which to listen to HTTP requests (default "0.0.0.0:8080")
  -allowed-origins string
	Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins (default "http://localhost:8080")
  -db-path string
	sqlite3 database path (default "db.sqlite3")
  -debug
	Whether to enable verbose logging
  -enable-solo-validators
	Whether or not to enable solo validator credentials (default true)
  -hmac-secret string
	The secret to use for HMAC.
	Value must be at least 32 bytes of entropy, base64-encoded.
	Use 'dd if=/dev/urandom bs=4 count=8 | base64' if you need to generate a new secret.
  -metrics-addr string
	Address on which to listen for /metrics requests (default "0.0.0.0:9000")
  -rescue-proxy-api-addr string
	Address for the Rescue Proxy gRPC API
  -rocketscan-api-url string
	URL for the Rocketscan REST API
  -secure-grpc
	Whether to use gRPC over TLS (default true)
```

  * `-hmac-secret` must match the one used with the
  [Credentials](https://github.com/Rocket-Rescue-Node/credentials) library
  that generated the username, password

## Docker

If you need to publish a new version of the Docker image, you can use the following
commands. You will need to be logged into Docker Hub.

### Requirements

  * [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Prepare the build environment

This step is needed only once.

```bash
make docker-prepare
```

### Build and publish the image

The following commands will build and publish the image with the specified version.
If you need to create a multi-arch image, you can edit `Makefile` and add
additional architectures to the `PLATFORMS` variable.

```bash
VERSION=<version> make docker-publish
```
